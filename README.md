Russianrouleth

A decentralized game of chance with Ethereum smart contracts.

Players can join a round by paying 0.01 ETH.
Every 6 participants, the smart contract selects one winner at random, who instantly receives roughly 6Ã— their entry fee.

Once a winner is chosen, a new round automatically starts, and anyone can join again.

Only on testnets right now as I'm not quite sure of the legal implications of this.
